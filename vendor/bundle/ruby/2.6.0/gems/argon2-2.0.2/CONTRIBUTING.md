# Contribution Guidelines

Any form of contribution is accepted, however, please note the following.

## Please note noncompliant issues or PRs will be closed without discussion

- Note the [Design Goals](https://github.com/technion/ruby-argon2/blob/master/README.md#design) documented for the project and work within them
- Commits should be squashed to a single commit per pull. An exception is that a test suite add or change, followed by code update, may be presented as two commits in one pull
- Each individual commit should have a descriptive commit message. "Update <file>" is not suitable
- This is a coding project. Your political goals are not relevant
- Any complex or large code will probably require a test
- If an issue is felt to be a security concern, please contact me privately on: technion@lolware.net
